## LiLo: Lite 3D-Lidar Odometry
This code obtains the odometry of a UGV ([BLUE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8374172) ) with the estimation of the position transform between two point-clouds (a current one with a previous one) obtained by a Velodyne VLP16 3D-lidar sensor.

This code is modified from [FLOAM](https://github.com/wh200720041/floam).

**Modifier:** Edison P. Velasco SÃ¡nchez, Universidad de Alicante, Spain.
